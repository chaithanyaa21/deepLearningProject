Project Title: Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data using Recurrent Neural Networks 
Project Description: The project aims to develop a sentiment analysis model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to analyze tweets and classify them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. By leveraging the sequential nature of text data, the RNN model will capture the contextual information and dependencies within tweets, enabling accurate sentiment classification.
